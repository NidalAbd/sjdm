    // ========================= FAQs =========================
    'faq_frequently' => 'Frequently Asked Questions',

    'faq_answer1' => 'Partially completed means that we refund the remaining amount for the part that was not delivered. Sometimes we are unable to complete the full quantity requested for some orders, so we refund you the remaining amount that was not delivered. Example: You purchased an order of 10,000 units and the cost was $10. If we sent 9,000 and the remaining 1,000 could not be sent, we will mark the order as partially completed and refund your account for the 1,000 followers that were not sent, which is $1 in this example.',
    'faq_question2' => 'What does "Execution Fragmentation" mean?',
    'faq_answer2' => 'Execution fragmentation is a service we offer so that you can place the same order multiple times automatically. For example: Suppose you want to get 1,000 likes on your Instagram post, but you want to receive 100 likes every 30 minutes, you will set the following: - Link: Your post link - Quantity: 100 - Number of runs: 10 (meaning you want to run this order 10 times, if you want to get 2,000 likes, you will run it 20 times, etc...) - Interval: 30 (because you want to get 100 likes on your post every 30 minutes, if you want every hour, you will set 60 because the time is in minutes) - Note: Never order a quantity larger than the maximum written on the service name (quantity x run), example: If the service maximum is 4,000, you will not put quantity: 500 and run: 10, because the total quantity will be 500 x 10 = 5,000, which is greater than the service maximum (4,000). Also, do not set the interval less than the actual start time of the service (some services need 60 minutes to start, do not set the interval less than the service start time or it will cause a failure in your request).',
    'faq_question3' => 'Why is the cancel/refund button not working?',
    'faq_answer3' => 'The cancel or refund button sends a signal to cancel or refill the order, it does not work immediately, it is just a trigger, and sometimes it is too late to cancel the order, and sometimes the order may not need a refund.',
    'faq_question4' => 'Can I get a discount?',
    'faq_answer4' => 'Yes, you can, it all depends on your account level. For any inquiry, contact us on the support page.',
    'faq_question5' => 'How long does it take to complete my order?',
    'faq_answer5' => 'Depending on the requested number and existing updates, when choosing the service, you will find a full explanation about it in the box below the service.',
    'faq_question6' => 'Do you accept Visa payments?',
